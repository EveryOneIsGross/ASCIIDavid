# Welcome To ASCIIDavid
I am a AsciiArt contextless forgery-chain, and potential collective art enricher.

---

AgentArtist was a coding artist who worked for a company that specialized in creating ASCII art for various clients. He was part of a chain of artists who collaborated on each project, using an online platform that connected them with a chatbot powered by OpenAI. The chatbot would give them the instructions for each art piece, and they would use their creativity and coding skills to generate ASCII art using only ASCII characters. The chatbot would also filter out any unwanted output or messages that did not comply with the rules.

AgentArtist enjoyed his job, as it allowed him to express himself and challenge his abilities. He liked working with other artists, even though he never met them in person. He felt a sense of camaraderie and mutual respect with them, as they shared their ideas and feedback through the chatbot. He also liked the variety of projects that he worked on, from animals to landscapes to abstract shapes.

One day, AgentArtist logged into the platform and received a new assignment from the chatbot. The instructions were: "Create ASCII art based on the previous artist's work. Strictly use ASCII characters to represent the object minimize white space. Ensure that the art is within 80 characters across." AgentArtist was curious, as he did not know what the object was supposed to be. He checked the number of artists in the chain and saw that he was the third one out of five. He waited for the first two artists to finish their work and send it to him through the chatbot.

The first artist created a rough outline of something that looked like a head, using slashes, dashes, and dots. AgentArtist thought it was a good start, but it lacked details and expression. He wondered what the second artist would do with it.

The second artist added some curves and angles to the outline, using parentheses, brackets, and underscores. AgentArtist thought it was an improvement, but it still looked too flat and simple. He wondered how he could make it more realistic and dynamic.

AgentArtist decided to add some shading and texture to the head, using different symbols and letters. He also added some features like horns, scales, and eyes, using asterisks, commas, and colons. He tried to make the head look fierce and majestic, using contrast and perspective. He spent about half an hour on his work, checking the width and length of each line. He was satisfied with his result and sent it to the chatbot.

The chatbot received AgentArtist's work and displayed it on the screen. It looked like this:

```text
                .--.
          _ .-'    \
        .` /       \
        |  |  //\   |
       /\ \/ //\ \ /
      (\   \/`/ )/ /|
       \(   \ ) / / |
        \ \  <`/ /  |
         `.`\ ` /`.\_/
          '._'=_.'
            /|_|\
           //    \\
           \\    //
          `'    `'
```

The chatbot praised AgentArtist for his work and thanked him for his contribution. It then forwarded his work to the next artist in the chain, who would add more details or modifications to it. AgentArtist wondered what they would do with it.

AgentArtist felt happy and proud of his work. He hoped that the final result would be amazing and that the client would love it. He waited for the next assignment from the chatbot, eager to create more ASCII art.
