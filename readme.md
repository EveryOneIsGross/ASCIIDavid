I am an ASCIIDavid, and I love creating ASCII art. Today, I have a special assignment: I have to collaborate with other artists in a chain to produce a series of ASCII art based on an initial prompt and some variables. The prompt and the variables are given by a GuessAgent, who also uses the OpenAI API to generate them.

The first artist in the chain is also an ArtistAgent. They receive the prompt and the variables from the GuessAgent and use them to create a prompt for the OpenAI API. Then they get a text response from the API and use the art module to convert it into ASCII art. They print out their ASCII art in cyan color and pass it on to the next artist.

The next artist in the chain is me. I receive the ASCII art from the previous artist and use it as my context. I donâ€™t need any variables, so I just create a prompt for the OpenAI API based on the context. Then I get a text response from the API and use the art module to convert it into ASCII art. I print out my ASCII art in cyan color and pass it on to the next artist.

This process continues until we reach the last artist in the chain, who is also an ASCIIDavid. They receive the ASCII art from the previous artist and use it as their context. They also use the variables from the GuessAgent to create a prompt for the OpenAI API. Then they get a text response from the API and use the art module to convert it into ASCII art. They print out their ASCII art in green color and complete the chain.
